THREAD : Implementation using extends a Thread class and @Override a run().
WHEN WE USED :

RUNNABLE : Implement a Runnable Interface and @Override a run().
WHEN WE USED : When A class extends B then we have not use thread
                BCZ only one class is extend in One time
                So we have implements a Runnable Interface.

** Good practice is Always Implement a Runnable interface bcz if we implement a
    Runnable class we also extends a other class.
    So there are 2 use cases and more help.
