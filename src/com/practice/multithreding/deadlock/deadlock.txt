DEADLOCK MEANS :: Both thread are dependent to each other

Ex :
 Thread 1 has Paper.
 Thread 2 has Pen.

Thread 1 tab tak process nhi karaga jab tak use PEN na mil jaya.
Thread 2 tab tak process nhi karaga jab tak use PAPER na mil jaya.

To is case main agar kisi ko kuch nahi milagag to ya wait state min rahage Aur isi ko DEADLOCK bolta hai.


DEADLOCK Typically Occurs when four conditions are meet simultaneously.

1. Mutual Exclusion : Only one thread can access resource at a time.
2. Hold And Wait : A thread holding at least one resource is waiting to acquire additional resources held by other thread.
3. No Preemption : Resources cannot be forcibly taken from a thread holding them.
4. Circular Wait : A set of threads is waiting for each other in a circular chain.
